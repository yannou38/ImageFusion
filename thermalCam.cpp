	This example implements a rudimentary heat camera in the serial terminal, using a matrix of ascii
	characters to represent the temperature of each pixel in the device. Start your terminal at 115200
	and make the window as small as possible for best effect.

	Hardware Connections:
	Attach the Qwiic Shield to your Arduino/Photon/ESP32 or other
	Plug the sensor onto the shield
